## Abstract
Amongst health indicators, the respiratory parameters are one of the key representatives of an individual’s health. However, it is difficult to quantify the respiratory parameters outside of the controlled clinical environment. The currently available clinical tools are invasive and require instrumentation that alters physiological respiration. In order to address this issue, we have developed the Intraoral Respirometer (IOR), a one of its kind discreet Bluetooth-enabled intraoral wearable that continuously measures the pressure and temperature variation inside the oral cavity. The IOR consists of a 23.4 x 17.7 x 2.0 mm electronic module, hermetically sealed inside an intraoral retainer. In this work, we present the preliminary results obtained with the IOR. The wearable’s respiratory rate measurement was compared to the state-of-the-art Optoelectronic Plethysmography for one subject and the preliminary results were promising. The wearable was evaluated on three subjects at rest under two different conditions: nasal breathing with a closed mouth, and semi-open mouth breathing.  The intraoral gauge pressure measured by IOR ranges between -2 and 2 cmH2O which is comparable to that of the literature [1]. The measured respiratory rate at rest is consistent amongst subjects ranges between 12-17 breast/min. Our preliminary result suggests that the IOR has promising application for continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters outside of the clinical environment, however, more testing is required.
